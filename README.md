# Basic_Circuit_Solver
Goal of my project:
  Create a functional circuit builder to emulate a basic circuit.

How?
  Starting from baby steps:
  Know how to add elements to a graph.
  Use Kirchoff's Laws for a basic Voltage -> Resistor -> Back to Voltage connection and compute Resistance or current using Ohm's Law.
  
  Future Plans:
  Create a user-friendly interface to build circuit
